About hangman
-------------

The game consists on trying to predict an initially unknown word, letter by letter.
In this game there are two roles: guesser and moderator.
Turns alternate between the two.

Guesser
-------

When guessing one letter, all the occurrences of this letter must be revealed.
If a guessed letter is not present in the word, one member of the hangman is added to the picture.

Moderator
---------

The moderator chooses the word to be guessed.
It is also the one responsible for validating the guesses and managing the hangman picture.

Endgame
-------

If all the members of the hangman are in place, the guessers lose.
If the word was correctly guessed, the guessers win.
